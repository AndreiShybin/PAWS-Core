# PAWS Core integration/staging repository


PAWS(PAWS) is an open-source privacy focused digital currency based on Bitcoins blockchain technology, Dash’s Masternodes and Zerocoin’s Zerocash Protocol, combining them to create a powerful and innovative technology. PAWS is also powered by Blackcoin Proof-of-Stake 3.0 and Bitcoin Core 0.10x code base using Quark hashing algorithm with a block time of 60 seconds.

A peer-to-peer digital currency that provides fast, zero cost payments to anywhere around the world, without any third-party intervention. PAWS is a fully decentralized global payment network allowing individuals to have full control of their finances.

Masternodes require a collateral of 1,000 PAWS and can be run on the Tor network for greater privacy. All transactions on the network are fully verifiable with a built-in blockchain explorer within the software itself. Thereward ratio of staking to masternodes depends on the block number.
